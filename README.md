## Getting started
  - Ensure you have python & pip installed
  - Run `pip install opencv-python`
  - Run `pip install matplotlib`
  - Run `pip install pandas`
  - Run `pip install scikit-learn`
    - Sometimes you need to use `pip3` if you don't have regular `pip`
  - To use the video model, drop in any high-resolution, normal speed video footage, and change the filename inside the script.
    - Do not commit these files as they will be large.
